Therefore, having up to date documents to prove the \ncompany’s compl iances will protect the c ompany for several years ahead.  \n \nA few important laws that you must refer to before creating the company’s employment \ncontracts are wage laws, labour laws, the contract act, 1872 and the local state’s employment \nlaws.  \n  \n     CODE O F CONDUCT  \n  \nThe code of conduct policy  of a company contains the vision, ethics and missio n of the \norganization and also It is created to build and maintain the right business environment for \nemployees.

Furthermore, it should also mention public holidays. \nFurthermore, the  leave policy  must also mention the percentage of salary cut that an \nemployee will see in the case of unpaid leaves or half -days.  All regular employees are entitled \nfor 18 Earned Leaves in a calendar year. However, if the employee has joined the \norganiz ation in the middle of the calendar year, then the quantum of Earned Leaves will be \npro rata  basis.  \nIn case of new joiners/employee transfer,  following rules of leave credit will be applicable:  \n \na) Employee joining/transferred before or on 10th of the  month: 1.5 Leaves  \nb)"
